# Feature Specification: Add TerminalBench Benchmark Suite

**Feature Branch**: `[001-add-terminalbench-benchmark]`  
**Created**: 2025-09-15  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Add TerminalBench benchmark suite"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As the maintainer of spec-kit, I want a TerminalBench benchmark suite that reflects our core CLI workflows so that I can spot performance regressions before shipping updates.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a set of approved TerminalBench scenarios covering the CLI workflows for `/specify`, `/plan`, and `/tasks`, **When** a maintainer runs the standalone benchmarking tool (`python -m tools.benchmarks`) against the `terminal-bench-core` dataset, **Then** the suite produces a report comparing current performance to the latest approved baseline for each command pathway while ensuring the agent executes the prescribed Spec Kit workflow before attempting each benchmark task and without exposing benchmarking controls to end users.
2. **Given** a completed benchmark run, **When** results exceed the agreed regression thresholds, **Then** the suite flags the affected scenario, links to the relevant TerminalBench artifacts, and routes the alert to the benchmark maintainers within one business day.
3. **Given** a change request that adds, removes, or edits a benchmark scenario, **When** the governance check runs, **Then** it verifies that the scenario mapping, baseline record, and required templates or scripts remain aligned with the published TerminalBench dataset registry entry.

### Edge Cases
- If harness run metadata shows environment drift versus the recorded baseline profile (e.g., Docker image digest, dataset version, CPU/RAM allocation), the suite must halt baseline comparison, record the diff alongside the run metadata, and require an explicit decision to re-baseline before publishing results.
- When a scenario fails functionally (tests fail) rather than due to performance, the suite must open a triage ticket bundling the harness command log, `agent.cast`, and `post-test.txt` so maintainers can remediate correctness issues prior to resuming performance analysis.
- When onboarding a new scenario without an approved baseline, classify its executions as provisional, require three consecutive passing runs on the approved environment, and capture those runs in the baseline record before enabling regression alerts.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST define benchmark scenarios that represent the highest-traffic CLI workflows spec-kit supports (initially `/specify`, `/plan`, `/tasks`) and document their user intent, prerequisites, required templates or scripts, and measurable success signals such as generated specification, plan, and task artifacts alongside the expected feature branch state.
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide maintainers with a repeatable, maintainer-only entry point under `tools/benchmarks` (separate from the end-user `specify` CLI) to initiate the TerminalBench harness on demand and during release validation, including pre-flight checks for required tools (Docker, uv, Terminal-Bench CLI) and dataset availability, and support running the full `terminal-bench-core` dataset.
- **FR-003**: System MUST capture benchmark outputs that include runtime, high-level resource usage, and success/failure indicators for each scenario, and attach TerminalBench artifacts (`run_metadata.json`, session recordings, pane logs, command history) to the run record.
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain a human-readable baseline record for each scenario with metadata such as approval date, triggering change, environment profile, dataset version, and steward sign-off.
- **FR-005**: System MUST flag a regression when scenario runtime rises by more than 15% or peak memory exceeds baseline by more than 20%, notify maintainers via the agreed incident channel, and mark the associated release validation check as failed until acknowledged.
- **FR-006**: System MUST assign a rotating Benchmark Maintainers guild to review scenario definitions, baseline health, and dataset version drift at least once every two weeks and within three business days of any new TerminalBench registry release.
- **FR-007**: System MUST map each scenario‚Äôs coverage back to the specification, planning, and task templates this project provisions, ensuring benchmark parity is preserved when templates or scripts change.
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide stakeholders with a run log and summary that highlight passes, regressions, blocked runs, and outstanding re-baselining actions in language suitable for non-technical reviewers.
- **FR-009**: System MUST document and enforce that benchmarking capabilities remain isolated from the customer-facing CLI experience by residing under `src/tools/benchmarks`, offering access only through maintainer tooling and automation channels.
- **FR-010**: System MUST include a TerminalBench-compatible orchestrator agent that wraps each `terminal-bench-core` task, ensuring the Spec Kit workflow (`/specify`, `/plan`, `/tasks`, execute generated tasks) is executed before delegating to any underlying LLM or scripted logic during benchmarking runs.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Benchmark Scenario**: Describes a user-visible workflow to measure, including intent, prerequisite state, tracked metrics, and associated templates or scripts.
- **Benchmark Run**: Captures the outcome of executing one suite iteration, with timestamps, environment notes, TerminalBench artifacts, and metric deltas compared against the baseline.
- **Baseline Record**: Authoritative reference metrics for each scenario, including approval metadata, environment profile, dataset linkage, and change history for accountability.
